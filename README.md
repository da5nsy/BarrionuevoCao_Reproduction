# BarrionuevoCao_Reproduction

An attempt to reproduce results from:
P. A. Barrionuevo and D. Cao, “Contributions of rhodopsin, cone opsins, and melanopsin to postreceptoral pathways inferred from natural image statistics,” Journal of the Optical Society of America A, vol. 31, no. 4, p. A131, Apr. 2014.

Whereas the paper reports average component weightings, here I have broken it down for individual images. See 'figures' folder.
e.g. f2_imX = reproducing figure 2 in the original paper for image X.
