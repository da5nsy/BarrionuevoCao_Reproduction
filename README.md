# BarrionuevoCao_Reproduction

An attempt to reproduce results from:
P. A. Barrionuevo and D. Cao, “Contributions of rhodopsin, cone opsins, and melanopsin to postreceptoral pathways inferred from natural image statistics,” Journal of the Optical Society of America A, vol. 31, no. 4, p. A131, Apr. 2014.

Whereas the paper reports average component weightings, here I have broken it down for individual images. See 'figures' folder.
e.g. f2_imX = reproducing figure 2 in the original paper for image X.

## Requires:

- Psychtoolbox (could probably be done without, but it makes it easy)
    Version: 3.0.14 - Flavor: beta - Corresponds to SVN Revision 8424
    Uses basic functions, presumably will be compatible with other versions.
- MATLAB Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox

## Variables:
```
im = image
D_CCT = Correlated colour temperature of the D series ill to be used
level = which level do you want to do this at? 
	(1 = LMSRI, 2 = lsri (with luminance removed before analysis)
Tn = number of sensitivities (T in psychtoolbox terminology)
	(3/4/5 = LMS/LMSR/LMSRI or 2/3/4 = ls/lsr/lsri)   
```

## TO DO list
- Non-linear CCT range
- This whole operation would run faster if I split everything here but
the last section (the pca) into a function, which would be called
something like 'get_im_LMSRI_c', and which would only be called once
per 'Tn', and then the pca could be done on the other side (in
BCRepro_caller.m). This seems like definitely the right thing to do but
there isn't the justification for me to do it right now, and so I shall
put up with it being slow.
